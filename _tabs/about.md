## Welcome to My Blog!
Hi there! I'm Julian Vazquez, a passionate cybersecurity professional and tech enthusiast based in Dallas, Texas. With a background in both practical and academic aspects of technology, I have a unique perspective on the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity and IT.

## My Journey
My journey into the tech world began with my studies in Computer Science at the University of North Texas, where I'm currently completing my degree. Along the way, I earned an Associate in Applied Science from Tarrant County Community College and graduated from the DevMountain Cyber Security Program. My academic pursuits have been complemented by industry-recognized certifications, including the Security+ certification.

## Professional Experience
Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects and roles that have honed my skills and fueled my passion for technology. From developing a book tracking app with React and NodeJS to constructing hash collisions to demonstrate vulnerabilities in cryptographic functions, my hands-on experiences have been both challenging and rewarding.

In my professional roles, such as working at FedEx Ground and ADT Security Services, I've gained invaluable experience in coordinating teams, managing IT infrastructure, and providing top-notch technical support. These experiences have not only sharpened my technical skills but also taught me the importance of communication, collaboration, and continuous learning.

## Why I Blog
I started this blog to share my knowledge, insights, and experiences with others who are as passionate about technology as I am. Whether you're here to learn about the latest in cybersecurity, get tips on programming and IT management, or simply to be inspired by the ever-evolving tech landscape, I hope you'll find valuable and engaging content here.
