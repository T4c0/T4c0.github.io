# A Capstone Project

![img-description](/assets/img/Book-Tracker-App/Screenshot%20(79).png)

This documents the capstone project i did for DevMountain titled "Book Tracking App".I really liked this project because it showed how the front end and the back end of application work together.

The capstone project was meant to show case what we had learned in foundations at DevMountain.Specifically it shows what we learned about styling and coloring the user side of an application, as well as the database, functionality, and responsiveness of the server side. Understanding HTTP GET, POST, DELETE, and many other HTTP methods helped appreciate websites that I use everyday.
