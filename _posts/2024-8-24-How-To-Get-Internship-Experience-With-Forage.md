# Personal Experience

I decided to put Forage to the test by trying out a few of their simulations. My first stop was the **JP Morgan & Co Cyber Security simulation**, which offered a variety of challenging tasks. The first task was to **analyze a large dataset of fraud in financial payment services**. This exercise required me to identify patterns and anomalies within the data, sharpening my analytical skills and giving me insight into the types of fraud financial institutions face daily.

The next task focused on learning about application **security fundamentals** and putting them to use on **my own website**. This was an incredibly hands-on experience, allowing me to directly apply security best practices to a real-world scenario, enhancing my understanding of how to protect web applications from common threats.

Finally, I tackled the **Spam or Ham? Build an Email Classifier task**, where I had to create a model to distinguish between spam and legitimate emails. This involved working with *machine learning algorithms and applying them to classify emails accurately*, which was both a challenging and rewarding experience.

Next, I tackled the **Commonwealth Bank Introduction to Cybersecurity simulation**. This one offered a broader overview of cybersecurity principles, perfect for someone looking to get their feet wet in the field. The tasks were challenging yet rewarding, helping me build a solid foundation of knowledge.

Finally, I completed the **Mastercard Cybersecurity simulation**, which stood out for its practical approach. Task One involved designing a **phishing email simulation**, where I had to craft an email that could test the awareness of potential targets within an organization. This task required a deep understanding of **social engineering tactics** and how they can be used to **exploit vulnerabilities**.

Task Two was equally challenging, as it required me to interpret the results of the phishing simulation I had designed. This involved **analyzing data to identify patterns**, **measure the effectiveness of the simulation**, and **suggest improvements for future security protocols**. It was a valuable experience that taught me the importance of vigilance and precision in cybersecurity.

Each simulation provided unique insights and hands-on experience that I wouldn’t have gotten elsewhere. These programs not only boosted my confidence but also gave me concrete examples of my skills that I can now highlight on my resume.
