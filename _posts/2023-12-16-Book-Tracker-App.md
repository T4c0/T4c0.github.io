# A Capstone Project

{% include embed/{youtube}.html id='{IEjSUpX_GH4&t=54s}' %}

This document highlights the capstone project I completed at DevMountain, titled "Book Tracking App." This project was particularly meaningful to me because it demonstrated how the front end and back end of an application work together seamlessly.

The capstone project was designed to showcase the skills I developed during the foundational courses at DevMountain. Specifically, it highlights my learning in areas such as styling and coloring the user interface, as well as managing the database, functionality, and responsiveness on the server side. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of HTTP methods such as GET, POST, DELETE, and others, which helped me appreciate the complexity and functionality of the websites I use daily.

Project Overview:

Front End Development:

I focused on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Key features included a dynamic search bar, interactive book lists, and responsive design to ensure usability across various devices.
Back End Development:

The back end was built using Node.js and Express, providing a robust framework for handling server-side logic.
I implemented a RESTful API to manage CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the book data stored in an internal database.
Key Learnings:

Styling and User Experience: Utilizing CSS frameworks like Bootstrap to streamline the design process while ensuring a consistent and professional look.
Database Management: Understanding the importance of efficient data storage and retrieval, and how to design schemas that support application requirements.
HTTP Methods: Gaining hands-on experience with various HTTP methods and how they facilitate communication between the client and server.
Future Updates:

Real-Time Updates: Implementing AJAX calls to update the book list dynamically without refreshing the page.
User Authentication: Handling user authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication and session management.
Conclusion:
Completing the "Book Tracking App" was a rewarding experience that reinforced my understanding of full-stack development. It allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting and gain insights into the intricacies of web development. This project not only improved my technical skills but also boosted my confidence in building and deploying web applications.
